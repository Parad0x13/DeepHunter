Deep Hunter gets it's name from a mix of different concepts starting with Deep Blue, the chess simulator that beat Kasparov, turning into Deep Green (the color of inteligence) which resembles the color hunter green. The concatenation of those two terms led to Deep Hunter

This software evolved from a previous simulator competition that went nowhere called 'chaz, Chess contest coordinator and game administrator' (https://github.com/theY4Kman/chaz)
